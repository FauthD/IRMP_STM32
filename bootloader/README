The bootloader is in [1].

The firmware, which gets loaded by the bootloader, has to make an USB reset for 
reenumeration. For this compile the firmware with "make Bootloader=1".

Once the bootloader is flashed, you flash the new firmware like this:
First run /path/FlashDFUSe.sh /path/newFirmware.bin,
then connect the board.

I made a patch for dfu-util, which lets's dfu-util loop, so this needs no longer be done in a script.
Patched binaries are in ../binaries.
