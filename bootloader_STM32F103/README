These patches are against Tormod Volden's unify_platforms  branch of his maple-bootloader github repository, date 13.1.2015. [1]

One is for the developer board, one for the red ST-Link emulator and one for the blue „remapped“ ST-Link emulator.

A pulldown resistor from USBD+ to the USB disconnect pin of 220 ohm needs to be added.
A pullup resistor of 1,5 kohm is already present.

In case the opendrain disconnect pin is reset, the disconnect pin is drawn to ground and the pulldown pulls USBD+ close to ground.
In case the disconnect pin is set, the disconnect pin is open and the pullup draws USBD+ to VDD.
