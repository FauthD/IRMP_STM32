# A simple Python example for a run light

## [RunLight.py](RunLight.py)
Shows a moving light from left to right and vice versa. Quite similar to my very first mockup.

It uses the hidapi, so please install that.

```pip install hidapi```

Need to install the [udev](../../udev/README.md) rules as well.

This free RP2040 based [USB sniffer](https://github.com/ataradov/usb-sniffer-lite) helped me with debugging. Thanks to Alex Taradov for providing this wonderfull tool.
