configure and monitor STM32IR

Usage:
stm32IRconfig /dev/hidraw1

program and read the eeprom (wakeups, macros and capabilities)
reset wakeups, macros and alarm
set and get the alarm
send IR
monitor (read) STM32IR, stop with ^C
handy to get the codes of the remote controls buttons, in order to program the eeprom acordingly

put the udev rule into your udev rules directory, then you don't need to give a device, just run ./stm32IRconfig
