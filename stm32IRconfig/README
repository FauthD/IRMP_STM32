configure and monitor STM32IR

Usage:
stm32IRconfig [/dev/hidraw1]

program and read the eeprom (wakeups, macros and capabilities)
reset wakeups, macros and alarm
set and get the alarm
send IR
monitor (read) STM32IR, stop with ^C

put the udev rule into your udev rules directory, then you don't need to give a device, just run ./stm32IRconfig
the irmplircd@.service is tested on opensuse 13.2
passing on %k is not really needed, you could use irmp_stm32 as well
