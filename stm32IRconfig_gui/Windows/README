Old way: 
Get hidapi-externals from https://github.com/downloads/signal11/hidapi/hidapi-externals.zip
Put the content of this folder into the directory hidapi, which has to be parallel to
hidapi-externals, so that both are in the same parent directory.

New way:
Build with libs fox-1.6.50, libpng-1.6.17 and zlib-1.2.8.
Those need to be in the folder hidapi-externals.
For directory structure see hidapi-externals.zip as a template.
Put the content of this folder into the directory hidapi, which has to be parallel to
hidapi-externals, so that both are in the same parent directory.

Hope to make it work with fox-1.7.51, too.
