The receiver is installed automatically.
If not, do a sudo apt-get install yavdr-hardware-irmp

Get a template map:
wget  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j1rie/IRMP_STM32/master/irmplircd/yaVDR-0.6.2%20Xenial/irmp.map
mv irmp.map /etc/irmplircd/irmplircd.map

The stm32IRconfig_gui can be used for building a keymap from the template /etc/irmplircd/irmplircd.map with the remote control.
Press "receive mode" and open /etc/irmplircd/irmplircd.map .
Click the line with the button's name, press the button on the remote, press "write IR" - repeat this for all buttons.
You can test the keymap immediately: After pressing the button on the remote, the red cursor should be in the coresponding line.
At the end press "save" and save the keymap.
Reboot in order to apply the changes.

Without gui:
Edit /etc/irmplircd/irmplircd.map and insert the codes from your remote control, which you see
with 'sudo irw /var/run/lirc/irmplircd' (or stm32IRconfig or stm32IRconfig_gui).

If you press button "1" and irw shows "070000000100 0 070000000100 IRMP" the line
in /etc/irmplircd/irmplircd.map needs to be "070000000100 KEY_1" and so on.
After 'sudo restart irmplircd' you should see "070000000100 0 KEY_1 IRMP", when you
press "1".
