get irmplircd from https://github.com/realglotzi/irmplircd
for automatic start and stop of irmplircd during boot and on device dis/reconnect
put the udev rule '70-irmp.rules' into your udev rules directory (/etc/udev/rules.d/) and
put the systemd service 'irmplircd.service' into your services directory (/etc/systemd/system/)
put the systemd-tmpfiles config file 'irmplircd.conf' into your tmpfiles directory (/etc/tmpfiles.d/)
and run "systemctl enable irmplircd.service" once

you want to know, if the computer was started by the receiver?
run irmpexec with an irmpexec.map which touches /var/log/started_by_irmp_stm32 on receiving 'FF0000000000'
if 'stat -c %Y /var/log/started_by_irmp_stm32' is greater than 'stat -c %Y /var/log/boot.msg', the
computer was started by the receiver
You may use this in VDR's shutdownscript in order to not shut down on the first power key press, if the computer is already running.
This is handy if you have a remote control with macros as the logitech and use one button to power
on not only VDR but other devices as well.
