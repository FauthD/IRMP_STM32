for automatic start and stop of irmplircd during boot and on device dis/reconnect
put the udev rule '70-irmp.rules' into your udev rules directory (/etc/udev/rules.d/) and

irmp_stm32.map needs to contain a line "ff0000000000 KEY_REFRESH"

You may use this in VDR's shutdownscript in order to not shut down on the first power key press, if the
computer is already running. See the example script.
This is handy if you have a remote control with macros as the logitech and use one button to power
on not only VDR but other devices as well.

irmpexec executes commands on an IR signal decoded by irmplircd.
For example an irmplircd.map line "070000000100 KEY_1" and an
irmpexec.map line "KEY_1 ls -l" executes "ls -l" on 070000000100.
