get irmplircd from https://github.com/realglotzi/irmplircd
to automatically start and stop irmplircd at boot time and on device dis/reconnect
put the udev rule '70-irmp.rules' in your udev rules directory (/etc/udev/rules.d/) and
put the systemd service 'irmplircd.service' into your services directory (/etc/systemd/system/)
put the systemd-tmpfiles config file 'irmplircd.conf' into your tmpfiles directory (/etc/tmpfiles.d/)
and run "systemctl enable irmplircd.service" once

want to know, if the computer was started by the receiver?
put the systemd service 'irmpexec.service' in your services directory (/etc/systemd/system/)
and run "systemctl enable irmpexec.service" once
irmp_stm32.map must contain a line "ff0000000000 KEY_REFRESH"
if /var/log/started_by_irmp_stm32 is newer than /var/log/boot.msg, the computer was started by the receiver
You can use this in VDR's shutdown script to avoid shutting down on the first power key press, if the
computer is already running. See the example script.
This is handy if you have a remote control with macros like the Logitech and you want to use one button to switch
on not only VDR but also other devices.

irmpexec executes commands on an IR signal decoded by irmplircd.
For example an irmplircd.map line "070000000100 KEY_1" and an
irmpexec.map line "KEY_1 ls -l" will execute "ls -l" on 070000000100.
