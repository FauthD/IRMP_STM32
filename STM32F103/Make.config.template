### Specify the target board here.
### Red --> Build for the "Red" ST-Link board
### Blue --> Build for the "Blue" ST-Link board
### StickLink --> Build for the ST-Link USB stick
### Dev --> Build for the classic STM32F103 development board
### blueDev --> Build for the blue STM32F103 development board
### blackDev --> Build for the black STM32F103 development board
### MapleMini --> Build for the Maple Mini board

### Enable this, if you use the bootloader. Does not apply for the Maple Mini.
#Bootloader=1

### If you enable the following option, your firmware will be able to drive the
### "active" pin of the mainboard power button directly. It is recommended
### to add a 220 ohms resistor between the wakeup pin and the active pin of the
### mainboards power button connector.
### Check it out, if this works for your motherboard, too (it probably will).
### Please be careful and don't damage your motherboard!
### Default is to build a firmware which is meant to drive the power button via
### an opto-coupler added between STM32 board and mainboard.
#SimpleCircuit=1

### Enable this, if you have a pulldown resistor for USB reset (legacy boards).
#PullDown=1
